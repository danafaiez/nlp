The reference text for the movie plot #1 (on the left):

 ref_doc = "The woman crept down the hall in the dark, holding baseball bat above her
 head, her arms shaking, lungs begging for air as she tried not to breath. She
 knew it was here, the one who stalked her, terrorized her, tried to kill her—she
 didn’t care what everyone said. She knew it was all of it was real, and now she
 was going to catch it and prove to everyone that she wasn’t insane. She was
 almost at the doorway. 5 more steps. 4 more steps. 3. 2. 1…BANG! She threw open
 door, and swung the bat with all of the force in her being"




The reference text for the movie plot #2 (on the right):

 ref_doc = "As the teenage boy stepped into the old mansion, his friends
 cackling behind him, he thought he could hear things that, he forced himself to
 believe, were in his head—rattling bones, scurrying rats, hushed whispers…and
 the slow drip, drip, drip, coming from a spot he told himself wasn’t really
 there; the red, oozing stain in the ceiling boards above. He only had to spend
 one hour in the house and he would prove to his friends that he wasn’t afraid.
 Just one hour. He took one last glance out the door before shutting out the
 light of the full moon, enclosing himself in complete darkness, with only the
 sound of his racing, terrified thoughts."
